# DungeonGame

For this project I used C# inside Unity to first generate a plane mesh. After that I add 'rooms' to this plane mesh with portals connected the rooms. These rooms and portals are randomly generated every time you replay the game.

### What I've Learned

* How vertices, meshes, etc. work in the background
* How to make a randomized dungeon
